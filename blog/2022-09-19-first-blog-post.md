Hello and welcome to Trevor Sullivan's technology blog.
I previously hosted my blog at https://trevorsullivan.net, but have decided to move from WordPress to the Docusaurus platform.
Docusaurus has the benefit of static site generation, which improves performance, declares everything as code, and removes the necessity of database maintenance.
