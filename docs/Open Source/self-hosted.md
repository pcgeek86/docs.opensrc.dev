# Self-Hosted Network Services

This list contains some open-source, self-hosted services that you might want to run on your own network, or for your small business.

Why should you self-host services, instead of using free SaaS platforms?
For starters, data privacy is a huge concern.
Many businesses have privacy policies in place, though it's not really possible to trust what they're doing with your data internally.
Even with a policy in place, rogue employees might still be able to access your data.
